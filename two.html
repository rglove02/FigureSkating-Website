                    Singles skating is exactly what it sounds like - there is one skater that performs jumps, spins and edge sequences that incorporate dance elements to a piece of music. 
                    The competitors are split up into women's and men's divisions as for some aspects of the sport that require immense strenght like jumps, male skaters have an advantage.

                <p class="width-100">
                    Competitive ice dance is always performed by a male and female skater in partnership. 
                    Although it is possible to perform a dance without a partner at lower competitive levels, getting the timing when performing a solo dance routine can be harder than trying to match a partner’s steps. 
                    This is the skating discipline that often looks the most romantic due to the primary focus being on the connection between the skaters, their moves on the ice and the music.

                        They competed in ice dance for 22 years and have won many medals.

                    <p>This Canadian couple are three time world champions and two time Olympic champions. 
                        They won a gold medal in ice dance for Canada at both Vancouver 2010 and PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics as well as a silver at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.
                    </p>
                    <p>The pair has amazing chemistry and it showed on the ice. 
                        Their routines were filled with emotion and expression. Unfortunately, they retired in 2019.

                <br>
                Pairs skating is different from ice dance as it includes complicatd lifts as well as jumps, spins and dance elements. 
                Because of those lifts, it is typically the discipline that looks the most dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pair skaters are required to perform two jump skills: side-by-side jumps, in which jumps are accomplished by each skater beside each other and in unison, 
                and throw jumps, in which the woman performs the jump when assisted and propelled by her partner.

                    Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford are a Canadian couple who are two time world champions and Olympic medalists. 
                    They won a bronze medal in pair skating for Canada at PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. 
                </p>
                <p>They won back-to-back world titles in 2015 and 2016, making them the first Canadian pair to successfully defend their world gold medal since Barbara Wagner and Robert Paul who won four straight from 1957 to 1960.
                </p>
                <p>Since they both had excellent singles skating skills, they could include the most difficult and breathtaking pairs jumps in their routines. 
                    These included side by side triple lutzes jumps executed in unison, and a quad throw salchow that starts with Eric tossing Meagan high into the air where she would spin four times before landing gracefully on one leg.
