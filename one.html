                <p>There are many different types of moves that need to be mastered to become a world class figure skater. These can be broken down into three categories:</p>

                    Jumps are arguably the most exciting element in figure skating as great skaters seem to defy the laws of physics. 
                    They jump and turn so quickly, the average viewer is often left asking “Was that a double, a triple or a quad turn?” 
                    One hint to figure this out is to look at how quickly a skater turns in the air.
                </p>

                        As humans can only be airborne for so long, skaters wanting to do multiple spins must be incredibly strong as well as incredibly aerodynamic and as fast as possible as soon as their feet leave the ice. 
                    </p>

                        footsteps, male single skaters have been routinely performing quad jumps since 1988, but female singles skaters only started to do quads in 2002 after Japanese skater Miki Ando landed hers. 
                        Given their difficulty, quad jumps are still less common in women’s singles skating than in men’s singles routines.

                    <p>Dance is an element of skating where the focus is on movement, timing and fluidity rather than on any jumps and spins. It seeks
                        to tell a story by moving and swaying on the edges of a pair of skates while ensuring each move is full of emotion.  
                        When performed properly,it should send shivers up your arms and allow you to forget that you are sitting in a cold arena watching a well rehearsed routine. 
                        Young skaters are introduced to dance through formal routines that get increasingly harder. 
                        These routines take the name of the form of dance and style of music they are meant to represent.

                    <p>Have you ever marveled at how a male skater effortlessly lifts his often smaller female partner up in the air, where she may spin, turn or be thrown before landing with the lightest touch back on the ice? 
                        Then you have no doubt been marveled at the world of lifts. There are different holds and different air positions which combined dictate the level of skill. 
                        Throw lifts,twist lifts and overhead lifts are prohibited in the ice dance discipline but are what help make pairs skating so dangerously breathtaking. <br>

                </ul>
                <p>It's the combination of holds and postions that help the most elite pairs shines while audiences sit in awe. </p>
